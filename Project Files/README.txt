That is an instructions file for running the project succssefully.
Please follow the instructions:

1) Start by running Prediction_Tool.m file. 
    Please note you have to define the input excel file location at the begging of the code(Angular_Velocity_Telemetry.xlsx).
2) Next, run the main.cpp file in the final_project_c zipped file.
    Please note you have to define the input text file location.
    The input text file was generated by the prediction tool in the previous step(encoder_rates.txt is an example).

Good Luck!
